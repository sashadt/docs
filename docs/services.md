# Overview

Services represent global, shared, and automatically managed Docker or Apex processes. When an application is dependent on these services, these services can be configured in RTS to be launched automatically along with the application. Thus, when launching an application, the associated services that are configured also get installed and started automatically.

For example:  When you launch the [Omni Channel Fraud Prevention](http://docs.datatorrent.com/omni_channel_fraud_app/) application, the following services are installed along with it:

* Online Analytics App
* Drools Workbench
* Superset Dashboards

Services can be predefined in an application or configuration packages.  Users can also manually create services using the Services Management or Application Configuration Launch pages.

DT Gateway launches the services based on service descriptors.  A service descriptor is a JSON based description of the service that comes with an application package or a configuration package.  All the services are monitored by DT Gateway at regular intervals.

When a service is started, the Gateway creates proxy connection for the service if the proxy address property is configured in the service descriptor.  This proxy connection can be used to access the actual service API/web interface using the Gateway connection address.  There might be cases where users do not have access to the actual service web interface, so using the Gateway proxy address allows users to access such services.

Below are three services that are packaged with DT premium applications:

* [Online Analytics Service](/oas) - This service provides analytic processing of event streams from various source applications in real-time. This is an Apex application, which provides the backend query service. The visualization for this query service is provided by Apache Superset.
* [Drools Workbench](/drools) - This service is a web application and repository which is used to manage Drools assets. It provides the capability to change the application functionality by using Drools-based rules. You can create, edit, or version the rules and apply these rules in the application.
* [Superset](/superset) - This service provides a rich set of data visualizations with an easy-to-use interface for exploring and visualizing data. Using this service, you can create and share dashboards as well as control the data sources that must be displayed on the dashboards.

# Management

You can view and manage installed services using the **Services** page. To navigate to the **Services** page, follow the steps below:

It also contains the applicable actionable buttons such as **view app**, **start**, **stop**, **edit**, **copy** and **delete**.  Note that the **view app** button is only visible if the service type is `apex` and the service is running.

**Service Details**

This table shows the configuration of the service.  It may also contain the Apex application ID if the service type is `apex` and the service is running and some metadata keys/values if the service provides such data.  The sample service instance above shows `QueryIP` and `QueryPort` with values of `192.168.2.135` and `46620`, respectively.  These metadata keys/values are provided by the service at run time.  This section will also show explicit metadata variables defined in the service descriptor.

**Proxy URL**

This section shows the proxy URL that users can use to access data provided by the service through the Gateway proxy.  The Gateway applies proxy request headers and proxy replace string settings when processing this URL requests.

# Docker Configuration

Some applications require services which are run in the Docker containers. For such services, you must install Docker (Version 1.9.1 or greater) on your system. Services can run in Docker installed on a remote system if Docker isn't installed on the system where the Gateway is running.

During the DT RTS installation, the Docker version is automatically detected. That Docker version is shown in the Docker section on the Configuration page. You can optionally configure the services to run in Docker installed on a remote system.

**Warning: If the system does not have a compatible version of Docker and the remote Docker host isn't configured, then Docker services will not work.**

To configure the remote Docker host, follow the steps below:

1. On the DT RTS console, click the settings icon located on the upper most right section of the page and select **System Configuration**. The **System Configuration** page is displayed.
2. Click the **Installation Wizard** button.
3. On the **Welcome** page, click the **Continue** button.
4. On the **Configuration** page, go to the **Docker** section and set the following:

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | Docker host | Enter the remote Docker host URL.<br/>For example: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` or `http://127.0.0.1:2376`<br/>_(Optional)_ |

5. Click **Continue** and complete the Installation wizard.

# Packaging Services

Services and dependent applications can be defined and included in the application package.  This service descriptor is defined in the **services.json** file.  This file is located in the **/src/main/resources/resources** directory of your Apex project.  When the project is built and packaged as an APA file, the **services.json** file is placed in the **/resources** directory inside the APA file.

#### Sample Services File

The following is a sample **services.json** file:

<pre><code>{

The **services.json** file contains two root level properties:

* [Services Property](#services-property)
* [Applications Property](#applications-property)

#### Services Property

Service descriptors are defined in the `services` property.  The services property is an array of JSON objects where each object defines a service.

**Service Descriptor Parameters**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | string | Service name, which should be globally unique and only include characters that HDFS file name friendly.<br/>For example: `superset-fpa`, `druid_workbench`, etc. |
| description | string | Short description about the service.<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| type | string | Services type must be one of the following values:<br/>`docker` - service is a Docker container.<br/>`apex` - service is an Apex application. |
| srcUrl | string | Specify the name of the Docker image if the service is Docker based or specify the path of the Apex application package if the service is Apex based.<br/><br/>An example of a Docker srcUrl: `datatorrent/superset-fpa:1.4.0`<br/><br/>An example of an Apex srcUrl:<br/>`${.dt.gateway.artifactHubLocation}/ws/v1/artifacts/com.datatorrent/`<br/>`dt-apoxi-oas/1.4.0-SNAPSHOT/download`<br/><br/>Another example of an Apex URL: `file:///path/to/apppackage.apa` |
| docker | json object | Specify the Docker details for he service.<br/>For example:<pre><code>{<br/>  "run": "-d -p 18080:8080",<br/>  "exec": "nginx -t -c ~/mynginx.conf"<br/>}</code></pre>**Note**: This property is required if the service type is `docker`.<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| apex | json object | Specify the Apex details for the service.<br/>For example:<pre><code>{<br/>  "appName": "OAS",<br/>  "launchArgs": {<br/>    ...<br/>  }<br/>}</code></pre>**Note**: This property is required if the service type is `apex`.<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| proxy | json object | Specify the proxy settings for the service.<br/>For example:<pre><code>{<br/>  "address": "localhost",<br/>  "followRedirect": false,<br/>  "requestHeaders": {<br/>   ...<br/>  },<br/>  "replaceString": [<br/>    ...<br/>  ]<br/>}</code></pre>_(Optional)_ |
| metadata | json object | Specify explicit metadata to use in the service.<br/>For example: <pre><code>{<br/>  "ipaddr" : "localhost",<br/>  "port" : 8080<br/>}</code></pre>With this metadata defined in the service, we can reference them in the service configuration as `${superset-fpa.ipaddr}` and `${superset-fpa.port}`, assuming the service name is `superset-fpa`.<br/>_(Optional)_ |

**Docker Details**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | 
| run | string | Specify the Docker run command details.<br/>For example: `--add-host druid_cluster:<GATEWAY_IP> -e OAS=fpa-online-analytics-service -e PORT=9090 -p 28088:8088` |
| exec | string | Specify the Docker shell command to execute after the Docker service is started.<br/>For example: `nginx -t -c ~/mynginx.conf` |

**Apex Details**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | 
| appName | string | Specify the Apex application in the APA to launch.<br/>For example: `OA` |
| launchArgs | json object | Arguments to use during the launching of the Apex service.<br/>For example:<pre><code>{</br>  "kafkaBrokers": "localhost:9092",</br>  "kafkaTopic": "analytics"<br/>}</code></pre>_(Optional)_ |

**Proxy Settings**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | 
| address | string | Host:port to which the proxy path forwards to.<br/>For example: `localhost:28088`<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| followRedirect | boolean | If this property is true, then the Gateway proxy will perform redirect when it sees the HTTP status code 302 in the HTTP response header from the service.  Therefore, the browser surfing the service proxy URL will never encounter the hTTP status code 302.<br/>**Warning**: Omitting this property or setting it to true may cause a maximum redirect error in the Gateway proxy.<br/>_(Optional, default: true)_ |
| requestHeaders | json object | Headers to be added to the request made by the Gateway to the proxy destination.<br/>For example:<pre><code>{<br/>  "X\_PROXY\_REMOTE\_USER": "dtadmin"<br/>}</code></pre>_(Optional)_ |
| replaceStrings | array of json object | Definitions that represents text replacement processing to be performed on the response body by the Gateway proxy.  Regular expression is supported as described in the [Java Regex Pattern Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html), which includes capturing group and back references.<pre><code>[<br/>  {<br/>    "matchMime": "text/html",<br/>    "matchUrl": ".*.html",<br/>    "matchText": "\"/static/",<br/>    "replaceText": "\"/proxy/services/superset/static/"<br/>  }</br>  ...</br>]</code></pre>_(Optional)_ |

**Replace Strings Details**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | 
| matchMime | string | Process only for this mime-type.<br/>For example: `text/html`<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| matchUrl | string | Process only when the URL matches this regular expression pattern.<br/>For example: `acct*`<br/>_(Optional)_ |
| matchText | string | Text to be matched in the response body.<br/>For example: `href=\"/static/` |
| replaceText | string | Text that replaces the matched-text.<br/>For example: `href=\"/proxy/services/superset-fraud-app/static/`<br/>_(Optional, default: '')_ |

**Note**: Explicit metadata, implicit and global variables such as `${superset-fpa.ipaddr}`, `${superset-fpa._state}`, `${.GATEWAY_CONNECT_ADDRESS}`, etc. are not currently supported in the replace strings definitions.

Example 1:

<pre><code>{
  "matchMime": "text/html",
  "matchUrl": ".*\.html",
  "matchText": "href=\"/static/",
  "replaceText": "href=\"/proxy/services/superset-fraud-app/static/"
}</code></pre>

The above example tells the Gateway proxy to process request URLs ending with `.html` and the response header mime-type equals `text/html`.  Once the URL and mime-type are a match, then the response body is transformed by replacing every occurrence of `href="/static/` with `href="/proxy/services/superset-fraud-app/static/`.

Example 2:

<pre><code>{
  "matchMime": "text/html",
  "matchUrl": ".*",
  "matchText": "num=([0-9]*)",
  "replaceText": "NUM=\"$1\""
}</code></pre>

The above example tells the Gateway to process requests where the response header mime-type equals `text/html`.  Once the mime-type is a match, then the response body is transformed by replacing every occurrence of `num=one or more digits` with `NUM="same digits"`.  For example: `num=25` becomes `NUM="25"`, `num=100` becomes `NUM="100"`, etc.

**Note**: The matchUrl in this case will match any URL so it could have been omitted.

In addition to the explicit metadata variables defined in the services, there are implicit and global variables that can be use in the service configuration also.  Implicit variables are specific to the service while global variables are specific to the Gateway.

**Note**: These variables are only applicable to the following properties: _srcUrl, proxy.address, docker.run, docker.exec and apex.launchArgs values (not names)_

**Implicit Variables**

| Item |  Description |
| ---- |  ----------- | 
| _type | This variable should resolve to the service type such as `docker` or `apex`.  The syntax to reference this variable is `${superset-fpa._type}`, assuming the service name is `superset-fpa`. |
| _state | This variable should resolve to the service status.  For a complete list of service status, see the [service status table](#all-service-status) in the Manage section. The syntax to reference this variable is `${superset-fpa._state}`, assuming the service name is `superset-fpa`. |

**Global Variables**

| Item |  Description |
| ---- |  ----------- | 
| GATEWAY\_CONNECT\_ADDRESS | This is the Gateway connection address.  The syntax to reference this variable is `${.GATEWAY_CONNECT_ADDRESS}`. |
| GATEWAY\_ADMIN\_USER | This is the Unix user that the Gateway runs as. The syntax to reference this variable is `${.GATEWAY_ADMIN_USER}`. |

#### Applications Property

Applications depending on services are defined in the `applications` property.  

**Applications Parameters**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | string | Apex application name, which exists in the current APA package. |
| requiredServices | array of json object | List of services in which this application depends on.  If one of the services depends on other services, transitive service dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly.<br/>For example:<pre><code>[<br/>  {<br/>    "name": "superset-fpa",<br/>    "requiredBeforeLaunch": true,<br/>    "transient": true<br/>  }<br/>  ...<br/>]</code></pre> |

`requiredServices` is an array of JSON objects where each object defines a service the application depends on.

**Required Services Parameters**

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | string | The service name this application depends on. |
| requiredBeforeLaunch | boolean | If this property is set to true, then the application cannot be launched until this service is started.<br/>_(Optional, default: false)_ |
| transient | boolean | If this property is set to true, then it is deleted when the application is killed or shutdown.<br/>_(Optional, default: false)_ |
